## Introduction
<p align="justify">
In the current times, clothing and apparel industry has a variety of options available which makes the job of a customer to choose among these products quite difficult. Moreover, next to the straight purpose of the product there are various other deciding factors that are used by the customers to make their choices, like the category of clothes, its fabric material, colours, and so on, which opens a clear opportunity for recommender systems involvement in their shopping experience. Moreover, to make the customers use such software while shopping it needs to have a touch of novelty, yet simple user experience design compelling them to try new technology, with an ease of access. With this project, we demonstrate a method that combines recommendations for clothing, that is often only available online, with an Augmented Reality application in a physical store, as well as a solution to help customers find the recommended products using AR-enabled navigation. An empirical analysis revealed that users valued the comparison and recommendation features, and hints at the possible benefits of such an approach. Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the study, there is enough data to conclude that this is a viable strategy that merits additional investigation. </p>
