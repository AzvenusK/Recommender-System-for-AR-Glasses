## Introduction
<p align="justify">
In today’s times the grocery products are getting more homogeneous as sometimes it is impossible for a customer to tell one product apart from the other. Moreover, next to the straight purpose of the product there are various other deciding factor that are used by the customer to make their choices for example in food products nourishment values, ingredients and category of the product play a vital role in the selection process, and consumers need some help and support in their decision making. The possibilities of a seller helping the consumer in this task is restricted, and given the seller in most cases doesn’t know much about his customer, until he picks a few products and buys them at the checkout counter, the task becomes even more difficult. Additionally, in big grocery stores like Walmart and Tesco, the shop has little to no interactions with the buyers and rarely address a message in form of recommendations unless asked and given enough information about their personal choices, which buyers may find intimidating. If we look at the same situation on the web presence, the task becomes much easier. 
In most of the sites for internet shopping we find recommendations based on previous searches, preferences and thing bought by the customer to help them with the decision making in the online shopping process. One of the sites that use it extensively is amazon.com, where you can even see things that the customer might consider buying alongside what they are buying or looking at on their website. These mechanisms on the website which give-out recommendations for customers or users are known as recommender system. Tracing back to the problem depicted earlier, we need a recommender system in real-life as well for the customers in need, and a way achieve such results is having such a system in Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses. 
Google Glass and Holo-Lens were the first augmented reality glasses launched in the industry receiving a lot of attention among the rapid development of smart devices and wireless communication. AR overlays the virtual graphics and information onto the real world using a camera as a sensor and enables live interaction. Augmented Reality glasses are the future of technological advancements, and one of the things that can be an asset in making them popular is the ability to recognize objects in real-time, determine the class of the object and give-out the best recommendations that the buyer can use to make choices in a grocery store as to what he/she can pick.
